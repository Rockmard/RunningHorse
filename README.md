# RunningHorse
A horse, an ASCII one, and he's running.

If you ever feeling down while coding, the Ascii horse will be there to save you.
Just launch the Makefile using **make** or **make re**.
It should create a file named ***fun***, just start the programm (using ./fun for example in the comsole).
The horse should be running.

To exit, just kill the programm (using CTRL+C for instance).
