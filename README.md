# RunningHorse
A horse, an ASCII one, and he's running.

If you ever feeling down while coding, the Ascii horse will be there to save you.<br>
Just launch the Makefile using **make** or **make re**.<br>
It should create a file named ***fun***, just start the programm (using ./fun for example in the console).<br>
The horse should be running.<br>

To exit, just kill the programm (using CTRL+C for instance).<br>
The code follows the 42norm btw.

## This should look like this :

for the ascii art (I don't know if he drew them but that's where I find it).
